## Network Signatures Engineer @ [Niometrics](https://www.niometrics.com)

Niometrics captures, organises and extracts insights from some of the biggest and most complicated datasets that our modern societies currently produce. We put a magnifying glass on the realities collectively constructed by billions of connected individuals and machines, making sense of how humanity is re-creating wholly new digital universes with bits and bytes – universes that need to be seen, interpreted and explained. From taking deep dives into digital behaviours, to exploring the most intimate interactions between network technology and user experiences, we do it all.

As a Network Signatures Engineer, you are expected to analyse network traffic samples in order to extract the distinguishing characteristics of the flows as well as reverse engineer the many custom protocols which are abundant in the network. You will write and maintain the signatures which classify the bits and bytes passing over the wire to the specific application and component.
