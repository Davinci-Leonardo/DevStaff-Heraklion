**Decisions**
	
*July Meetup:*

 - Password + Key Management (8/8 votes)

*August Meetup:* 

 - DevSteak

	
*Improving meetup sessions*

 - Meetup sessions will adhere "lightly" to the following (8/8 votes). A
   better management is required in order for this schedule to be
   communicated as well as "enforced".
```
	08.00 - 08.15 Intro
	08.15 - 08.35 Session 1
	08.35 - 08.55 Session 2
	08.55 - 09.10 Break
	09.10 - 09.30 Session 3
	09.30 Networking time
```
 - 1 slide intro is a must
 - 1 week before meetup organize meeting between speakers (to coordinate
   schedule) and decide on titles, content and presentation flow.

	
*Org Team Meetup*

 - Keep meeting minutes (WorkLife)
 - Org Team to monitor gitter and suggest to people to open issues or
   suggest hack sessions
