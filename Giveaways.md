# Giveaways
From time to time DevStaff has the opportunity to offer some giveaways during
the Meetups. The prizes are provided by
[sponsors](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/blob/master/Sponsors.md)
in exchange for promotion.

The process, the tools, and the rules we use for these giveaways are described
here.

## Prizes list
All prizes will be written down at each Meetup's announcement at
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/). Moreover, at the intro
presentation, when sponsors are presented, each prize will be explicitly
mentioned along with the type, the amount of prizes, and the sponsor.

## Participants eligibility
All participants of a Meetup are eligible for the raffling process including 
the speaker(s), attendees, and Org Team members. The participants of a Meetup 
are the members that have joined our Meetup's place (in case of physical 
Meetups) or our communication tool (in case of remote Meetups).

## Raffle Process
At the end of each meetup, we are using our [draw
app](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/devstaff-draw) to pick the necessary
amount of prize winners. They are then contacted within a week by an Org Team
member to collect their shiny new tool / license / swag!

The whole raffle process described at this step will take place during the end 
of the Meetup (live or) in front of all the participants.
